# 📂 Shared Common Directories With Samba  
**Kali Linux / Ubuntu / Debian Setup**

This setup demonstrates how to share directories such as `/opt/data` and `/backup` over the network using Samba, with appropriate permissions and configurations.

---

## 📁 Create and Prepare Shared Directories

**Create the `data` directory under `/opt`:**
```bash
cd /opt/
sudo mkdir data
```

**Set wide-open permissions (read/write/execute for all users):**
```bash
sudo chmod 777 /opt/data/
```

**Create the `backup` directory:**
```bash
sudo mkdir /backup/
```

**Set sticky bit and full permissions to preserve file ownerships while allowing write access:**
```bash
sudo chmod -R 1777 /backup/
```

> `1777` permission allows anyone to write to the directory, but only the owner can delete their files — commonly used for directories like `/tmp`.

---

## ⚙️ Configure Samba Shared Folders

Edit the Samba configuration file:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf
```

Append or update with the following configuration:

```ini
[global]
workgroup = SAMBA
security = user
passdb backend = tdbsam

printing = cups
printcap name = cups
load printers = yes
cups options = raw

[homes]
comment = Home Directories
valid users = %S, %D%w%S%
browseable = no
read only = no
inherit acls = yes

[printers]
comment = All Printers
path = /var/tmp
printable = yes
create mask = 0600
browseable = no

[print$]
comment = Printer Drivers
path = /var/lib/samba/drivers
write list = @printadmin, root
force group = @printadmin
create mask = 0664
directory mask = 0775

[data]
comment = Data
path = /opt/data
public = yes
writable = yes
guest ok = no
guest only = no

[backup]
comment = Server Backup
path = /backup
public = yes
writable = yes
```

---

## 🔁 Restart Samba Service

Apply the configuration changes:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart smbd
```

---

## 🧪 Accessing the Shares

**Test the shares using `smbclient` from another Linux machine:**
```bash
smbclient -L //192.168.112.145 -U smb-user1
```

**Mount the share manually:**
```bash
sudo mount -t cifs //192.168.112.145/data /mnt/data
```

**For the backup share:**
```bash
sudo mount -t cifs //192.168.112.145/backup /mnt/backup -o username=your_samba_user,password=your_password,vers=3.0
```

> 📌 Create `/mnt/data` and `/mnt/backup` directories before mounting if they don’t exist.

---

## 🔐 Access Control Note

Although `public = yes` is set, `guest ok = no` ensures only **authenticated users** can access these shares.  
You can manage permissions more tightly by adding `valid users` or `write list` directives as needed.

Let me know if you’d like this in `.md` format or want it reversed back to RHEL-based systems.
