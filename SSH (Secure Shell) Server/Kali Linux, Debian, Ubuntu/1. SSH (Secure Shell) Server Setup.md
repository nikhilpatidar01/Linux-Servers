# 🚀 SSH (Secure Shell) Server Setup on Kali Linux/Debian/Ubuntu

## 🔍 Check if OpenSSH is Already Installed

To verify if any SSH-related packages are already installed:

```bash
dpkg -l | grep openssh
```

---

## ❌ Remove Existing OpenSSH Server (If Needed)

If an existing OpenSSH server installation needs to be removed before installing a fresh one:

```bash
 apt remove openssh-server
```

---

## 📦 Install OpenSSH Packages

### Option 1: Install all SSH-related packages using a wildcard:

```bash
 apt install openssh*
```

### Option 2: Install packages individually for more control:

Install the OpenSSH server:

```bash
 apt install openssh-server
```

Install the client tools for connecting to SSH servers:

```bash
 apt install openssh-client
```

---

## 📋 Check Package Information

View detailed information about the installed OpenSSH server package:

```bash
dpkg-query -s openssh-server
```

List all files installed by the OpenSSH server package:

```bash
dpkg-query -L openssh-server
```

List all configuration files related to the OpenSSH server:

```bash
dpkg-query -c openssh-server
```

Display documentation files included in the OpenSSH server package:

```bash
dpkg-query -p openssh-server
```

---

## 🛠️ Manage the SSH Daemon with systemd

Check the current status of the SSH daemon:

```bash
systemctl status ssh
```

Start the SSH service:

```bash
 systemctl start ssh
```

Enable SSH to start automatically on boot:

```bash
 systemctl enable ssh
```

---

## ✅ Verify SSH Service is Running

Check if the SSH daemon is listening on the expected ports (usually port 22):

```bash
netstat -nltup | grep sshd
```

> **Tip:** If `netstat` is not available, install it using:

```bash
 apt install net-tools
```

Or use `ss` as an alternative:

```bash
ss -nltup | grep sshd
```

---

Let me know if you want to **extend this** to include:

- 🔧 SSH configuration (`/etc/ssh/sshd_config`)  
- 🔥 Firewall setup using `ufw` or `iptables`  
- 🔐 Key-based authentication for secure login  
```
