# 🐙Squid Proxy Server Setup on CentOS

### **What is Squid Proxy Server (in short)?**

**Squid** is a caching and forwarding **HTTP proxy server** that improves web performance by **caching** frequently requested web content and controlling access to the internet. It supports HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, and more.

---

### **Where is Squid Proxy Used?**

- **Organizations & Enterprises** – to restrict, monitor, and speed up employee internet usage.
- **Schools & Universities** – for internet access control and content filtering.
- **Home networks** – for parental control or bandwidth savings.
- **ISPs** – to reduce bandwidth by caching popular sites.

## 1. Check Repositories and Existing Installation

1. **List all enabled repositories**  
   ```bash
    yum repolist all
   ```
2. **Check if any Squid packages are already installed**  
   ```bash
    rpm -qa | grep squid
   ```

## 2. Install Squid

1. **Install the Squid proxy and related packages**  
   ```bash
    yum install -y squid*
   ```

> *On CentOS 8+, you may need to use ` dnf install -y squid*` instead.*

## 3. Verify Installation

1. **Confirm Squid packages are installed**  
   ```bash
    rpm -qa | grep squid
   ```
2. **Show detailed information about the Squid package**  
   ```bash
   rpm -qi squid
   ```
3. **List configuration files provided by the package**  
   ```bash
   rpm -qc squid
   ```
4. **List documentation files**  
   ```bash
   rpm -qd squid
   ```
5. **List every file installed by Squid**  
   ```bash
   rpm -ql squid
   ```

## 4. Edit Squid Configuration

1. **Open the main config file in your editor**  
   ```bash
    vim /etc/squid/squid.conf
   ```
2. **Example: allow only your internal network Subnet**  
   ```conf
   acl localnet src 192.168.1.0/24
   http_access allow localnet
   ```
3. **Ensure Squid listens on port 3128** (default)  
   ```conf
   http_port 3128
   ```
> _Add or tweak cache settings, logging options, authentication, etc., as needed._

## 5. Manage Squid Service

1. **Enable Squid to start at boot**  
   ```bash
    systemctl enable squid.service
   ```
2. **Start (or restart) the Squid service**  
   ```bash
    systemctl restart squid.service
   ```
3. **Check the status of Squid**  
   ```bash
    systemctl status squid.service
   ```

## 6. Verify Squid Is Listening

1. **Using netstat**  
   ```bash
    netstat -tulpn | grep squid
   ```
2. **Alternatively, using ss**  
   ```bash
    ss -tulpn | grep squid
   ```
> You should see Squid bound to `0.0.0.0:3128` (or your configured interface).

## 7. Configure Firewalld

1. **Check firewalld status**  
   ```bash
    systemctl status firewalld
   ```
2. **Start and enable firewalld if it’s not running**  
   ```bash
    systemctl start firewalld
    systemctl enable firewalld
   ```
3. **Open Squid’s port (3128/TCP) permanently**  
   ```bash
    firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=3128/tcp
   ```
4. **(Optional) Allow DNS lookups if needed**  
   ```bash
    firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=53/tcp
    firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=53/udp
   ```
5. **Reload firewalld to apply all changes**  
   ```bash
    firewall-cmd --reload
   ```
6. **View current firewall settings**  
   ```bash
    firewall-cmd --list-all
   ```

## 8. Monitor Logs and Traffic

1. **Follow the Squid access log in real time**  
   ```bash
    tail -f /var/log/squid/access.log
   ```
2. **Capture packets on your network interface**  
   ```bash
    tcpdump -i enp0s8 -w /root/squid_traffic.pcap
   ```
3. **Read and analyze the captured pcap file**  
   ```bash
    tcpdump -r /root/squid_traffic.pcap
   ```

### 🧾 **Conclusion**

The Squid Proxy Server is a powerful and flexible solution for controlling and optimizing internet access in various environments like offices, schools, ISPs, and home networks. With proper installation and configuration on CentOS, Squid can:

- **Improve network performance** through caching,
- **Enhance security and monitoring** of user traffic,
- **Control access** with ACLs and firewall integration,
- And **reduce bandwidth usage** by serving cached content.

# Proxy Server with Dual Network Interface  
*Configuration and Conceptual Workflow*

---

## 1. Bridged Adapter on Proxy Server OS 
![Dual Interface – Bridged Adapter](https://github.com/nikhilpatidar01/Linux-Server/blob/Master/Proxy%20Server/CentOS/Configuration%20Images/1.%20Dual%20Interface%20Brighe%20Adaptor%20on%20Proxy%20server.png)  
> **Figure 1:** The proxy VM has two NICs:  
> - **eth0 (External):** Connected to the host network (bridged/NAT).  
> - **eth1 (Internal):** Connected to a private “Internal Network” for clients.

---

## 2. Internal Network on Proxy Server OS

> **Figure 2:** Address plan:  
> - **Proxy eth0 (External):** e.g. `192.168.95.145`  
> - **Proxy eth1 (Internal):** `192.168.1.1/24`  
> - **Client PC1:** `192.168.1.2/24`, gateway `192.168.1.1`

 ip link set eth1 up
```

> **Figure 8:**  
> ```text
> Client → Proxy (eth1) → Proxy (eth0) → Internet
> ```  
> All client requests route through the proxy, which then forwards to the outside world.

## Next Steps

1. **Install & Configure Squid** on the proxy VM (e.g. allow only the 192.168.1.0/24 ACL).  
2. **Enable IP forwarding** and any necessary firewall or NAT rules.  
3. **Test HTTP/HTTPS** through the proxy and monitor logs.
